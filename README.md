# üíª: BMVC 2022 : Resolving Semantic Confusions for Improved Zero-Shot Detection

##  :scroll: Introduction
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of our [BMVC 2022](www.bmvc2022.org) paper : Resolving Semantic Confusions for Improved Zero-Shot Detection, a work done by Sandipan Sarma, Sushil Kumar and Arijit Sur at [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/). 


- Supervised deep learning-based object detection models like Faster-RCNN and YOLO have seen tremendous success in the last decade or so, but are limited by the availability of large-scale annotated datasets, failure to recognize the changing object appearances over time, and ability to detect unseen objects.

- **Zero-shot detection (ZSD)** is a challenging task where we aim to recognize and localize objects simultaneously, **even when our model has not been trained with visual samples of a few target (‚Äúunseen‚Äù) classes**. This is achieved via knowledge transfer from the seen to unseen classes using semantics (attributes) of the object classes as a bridge.

- Existing methods 

- We propose a **generative approach and introduced triplet loss** during feature generation to account for inter-class dissimilarity.

- Moreover, we show that maintaining cyclic consistency between the generated visual features and their class semantics is helpful for improving the quality of the generated features.

- Addressed problems such as high false positive rate and misclassification of localized objects by resolving semantic confusion
